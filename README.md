# c18-test-repo

This is the test push/pull repo for C18.

If you are in that cohort you have 'push rights', which basically menas direct access.

When we set you to it,

* Make a change
* Push it
* If you get the message that you are not up to date, then pull (merge, potentially) and then push your changes.

Also, try to make a pull request here to see it get accepted.
